# UUIDDartPackage
A dart package for generating uuids

This package is going to be submittes through the pubspec system to allow people who want to generate GUIDs for their flutter apps. While this is going to be a basic dart package, and not a flutter unique package, it will be mostly meant for flutter development as the dart language already has a GUID package. howver, for reasons which are not clear, this does not work in flutter projects.
